The 12th and 13th centuries, however, saw a gradual weakening of the Popes' secular control, and dozens of local rulers came to power through various means. While most of these lands are still nominally within the Papal dominion and acknowledge some degree of temporal authority of the Holy Father, they nonetheless act in all matters as practically independent nations. \n \n(Autonomous Papal States may be converted into normal vassals through a special Papal diplomatic action)"

 #New Reform System Gov Stuff
 irish_clann_reform:0 "Clann"
 irish_clann_reform_desc:0 "Clanns were the primary local political and social unit in Gaelic Ireland. The hereditary system was highly stable, but its power structures were exceptionally weak and decentralized for early modern Europe and its largely rural population was quickly becoming unable to compete in a modernising Europe."
 provincial_kingdom_reform:0 "Provincial Kingdom"
 provincial_kingdom_reform_desc:0 "Ríthe Ruireach, or Overkings (also often call Ríthe Cúige, or Provincial Kings), were influential local kings, exercising their power over one of the ancient 5 provinces of Ireland. Historically second only to the High King, and indeed being the candidates from which most High Kings were chosen, these local kings were some of the most powerful men in Gaelic Ireland. Despite their influence, however, they often lacked the power structures and centralisation of larger European states, though not to the extent of the local Clann chiefs."
 tanistry_reform:0 "Tanistry"
 tanistry_reform_desc:0 "Tanistry is the traditional inheritance system of Ireland and Britain. Under this system, a Tanist is elected by popular vote of the Dearbhfhine, or the decendants of a previous king up to four generations back, from the available Righdamhna, or kingly material, who are Dearbhfhine of the age of majority and without any physical or mental deformity. Unlike most primogeniture succession laws on the continent, it is common for a brother, uncle, or nephew to be first in line to inheirit, and also unlike most elective monarchy laws on the continent, only the direct descendants of previously ruling kings were eligible. This system is highly stable and typically ensures a compentent king is chosen, but it also occasionally causes civil wars between cousins."
 norman_lordship_reform:0 "Norman Lordship"
 norman_lordship_reform_desc:0 "Norman Lordships are positions created by Anglo-Norman powers following the Norman conquest of Ireland in 1172, into which they installed loyal Anglo-Norman lords as a reward for miltary service as well as to ensure continued control over Ireland. Nominally vassals of the English monarch, these lordships quickly became de facto independent, and shared far more with their Gaelic neighbours than their distant English cousins."
 norman_duchy_reform:0 "Hiberno-Norman Duchy"
 norman_duchy_reform_desc:0 "A title granted by the English monarchy empowering the holder to rule one of the ancient provinces of Ireland in their name. Historically a replacement for the native provincial kingdoms, this title came to represent pervasive and aggressive English influence in Ireland, but they were also highly effective at squeezing out every last ducat from their subjects."
 anglo_irish_monarchy_reform:0 "Anglo-Irish Monarchy"
 anglo_irish_monarchy_reform_desc:0 "A form of constitutional or representative monarchy based on the English parliamentary tradition of Westminster, with a parliament called regularly by the ruling monarch. It is based on the privileges defined in Magna Carta and adapted to the local economy."

 btpIRE.EVTDESC2:0 "Our former vassals, vested with their positions and titles by our very throne years ago, are refusing to acknowledge our rule and declaring themselve independant rulers of our land! Even worse, there is talk that some of our holdings in Ireland may join with these usurpers, plunging our holdings in Ireland into civil war!"
 btpIRE.EVTOPTA2:0 "Reclaim our land at once!"
 btpIRE.EVTOPTB2:0 "This slap in the face will have to go unanswered, for now..."
 btpIRE.EVTNAME3:0 "An Independent Government"
 btpIRE.EVTDESC3:0 "Our government, now independent from British control, faces many unique challenges. It must now reform and reorganise itself and, bereft of its former mandate to represent foreign interests in Ireland, reevaluate its priorities. Only time will tell will come from this metamorphosis, but whatever it may be, at least Ireland will now be free!"
 btpIRE.EVTOPTA3:0 "An important step."
 btpIRE.EVTNAME4:0 "The Future of Ireland"
 btpIRE.EVTDESC4:0 "After five tumultuous years of civil unrest, politcal debates, legal analysis, and passionate addresses the transitional government is preparing to make its final decision regarding the future of our fair nation.\n\nShall we returrn to the ancient Gaelic High Kingship, or shall we keep the traditions of our former British overlords, only this time enrich Ireland, not London?"

 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTNAME1:0 "Faroese Culture Emerges"
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTDESC1:0 "A unique and distinct language and culture evolved from Old West Norse on the Northern Isles, know as Faroese and Norn. While initially still mutually intelligible with Norwegian, it slowly drifted away as Norway came more and more under the influence of Danish and East Norse, while the inhabitants of the Northern Isles maintained older traditions and even borrowed from nearby Gaelic traditions."
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTOPTA1:0 "Concerning news."
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTNAME2:0 "Celtic Solidarity"

 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTNAME4:0 "Distinct Norse-Gaelic Culture Fades"
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTDESC4:0 "The Gall-Ghaeil, or foreign Gaels, so called because they were ethnically Norse but culturally Gaelic, were once a dramatically different people than their native neighbours. As time wore on, however, the traditions and traits which defined them gradually faded and merged with their Gaelic allies. By the end of independent Norse-Gaelic kingdoms in Britain and the annexation of the Lordship of the Isles, these Norse-Gaels were quickly becoming indistinguishable from their Highland Scottish kin."
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTOPTA4:0 "This should help the economy."
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTNAME7:0 "Fate of the Spanish Moors"
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTDESC7:0 "In a foolish decision of faith over economy, [From.GetName] have caused many of the Moors still living in their lands to leave."
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTOPTB7:0 "No, close our borders. These refugees look like troublemakers."
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTNAME8:0 "Rise of the Republic of Salé"
 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTDESC8:0 "The unruly population of the coastal estuary of the Wadi Sala has annouced the intention to found a republic, funded by very successful pirating endeavours against European trading routes. We could either allow this minor republic, and try to excercise some control over it, or forbid it at risk of open rebellion."

 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTDESC1:0 "From at least the 12th century, Brugge was the richest and most important port in the North Sea. However, the Golden Inlet, the primary route to the North Sea from Brugge and also the reason for its immense wealth, began to fill with silt around the year 1500, leading to a progressive and sudden reduction of Brugge's importance as a centre of trade in the Low Countries as more and more trade moved to Antwerp."
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTOPTA1:0 "No! Spare no expense to clear the channel!"
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTOPTB1:0 "There is nothing that can be done."
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTOPTC1:0 "Order the port and commerce moved to Sluis, nearer the sea."
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTNAME2:0 "Rise of Antwerp"
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTDESC2:0 "When the Golden Inlet filled with silt and trade shifted away from Brugge, the richest city in the North Sea for many centuries, it shifted in large part to Antwerp, which quickly rose to become the richest port in the North Sea, perhaps even the richest in the world."
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTOPTA2:0 "Wonderful!"
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTNAME3:0 "Fall of Antwerp"
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTDESC3:0 "Antwerp, one of the richest cities in the world by the late 16th century, was a very ripe target due to its wealth a relative lack of protection. In 1576, soldiers unhappy with their pay sacked and plundered the city, prompting a mass emmigration north, mostly to Amsterdam. After this, Antwerp would never again regain the importance and wealth it previously had."
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTOPTA3:0 "No! Protect the city at all costs and reimburse everyone!"
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTOPTB3:0 "There is nothing that can be done."
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTNAME4:0 "Rise of Amsterdam"
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTDESC4:0 "When Antwerp was sacked by the Spanish Fury, many of the skilled artisans, wealthy traders, and influencial families fled north, mostly to Amsterdam. This sudden immigration led to the rise of Amsterdam as a major world power and contributed to the so called 'Dutch Miracle', the transition of the Low Countries from minor vassal states to a major world power over the course of only 50 or 60 years."
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTOPTA4:0 "Wonderful!"
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTNAME5:0 "Golden Age of Amsterdam"
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTDESC5:0 "The Dutch Golden Age saw the growth of Amsterdam into the richest city in the world by the middle of the 17th century. At the head of a global trading network, its population exploded from under 5,000 in the early 15th century to nearly 250,000 in the 17th century."
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTOPTA5:0 "Excellent news!"
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTNAME6:0 "End of [Root.GetName]'s Golden Age"
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTDESC6:0 "No longer at the head of a sprawling, eponymous trade empire, The province of [Root.GetName] is losing some of its influence. Though still an important commercial centre and trading port, many opportunistic traders and discriminating artisans are moving away to seek their fortunes elsewhere and the port no longer excercises the overwhelming dominance over local trade it previously enjoyed."

 #Ireland's slightly particularistic religion events
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTNAME1:0 "Tenaciousness of Irish Catholicism"
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTDESC1:0 "The Gaelic population of Ireland, as a whole, stubbornly and stalwartly maintained Catholic traditions in the face of the Reformation, despite immense pressure from the Protestant Ascendancy and a series of Penal Laws designed to force the acceptance of Protestantism and the Church of Ireland. The continued attempts of the English, British, and Anglo-Irish to convert the Gaels led to many rebellions from the very start of the Reformation. Occasionally, however, a deal was struck that the Irish would be allowed to maintain their Catholicism in exchange for a pledge of loyalty to Dublin or London."
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTOPTA1:0 "We must unite the Nation! Force the Gaels to accept the Reformation."
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTOPTB1:0 "We cannot afford to press this issue. We must first secure the loyalty of our subjects."
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTNAME2:0 "Advance of the Ascendancy"
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTDESC2:0 "The papal domination over the Irish population of [Root.GetName] has ended, and has been displaced by a new majority."
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTOPTA2:0 "Interesting tidings."
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTNAME3:0 "Tenaciousness of Irish Catholicism"
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTDESC3:0 "The Gaelic population of Ireland, as a whole, stubbornly and stalwartly maintained Catholic traditions in the face of the Reformation. The abject failure of the Reformation to take hold in Gaelic Ireland is attributed to a variety of factors, foremost amongst which may have been the fact that, contrary to most other Reformist and Protestant movement in Europe, the Church of Ireland refused to make use of the local language, instead disseminating materials in English. Combined with Ireland's disillusionment with England's foreign policy this created the perception that the Reformation was yet another attempt to conquer Ireland and break Gaelic influence. Another important factor, however, was support and training from continental Catholic allies who feared the ramifications of a religiously unified British Isles.\n\nAll the more was our surprise to learn that the Reformation had taken taken hold in [Root.GetName]. What do we do?"
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTOPTA3:0 "Request support from our Catholic brothers and fund priests to save these souls at once!"
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTOPTB3:0 "Let these heretics believe what they may, their contacts may even boost the local economy."
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTNAME4:0 "Tenaciousness of Irish Catholicism"
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTDESC4:0 "The Gaelic population of Ireland, as a whole, stubbornly and stalwartly maintained Catholic traditions in the face of the Reformation, despite immense pressure from the Protestant Ascendancy and a series of Penal Laws designed to force the acceptance of Protestantism and the Church of Ireland. One important factor in this resistance was the support and ecclesiastical training of Gaelic priests by continental Catholic allies who feared the ramifications of a unified Protestant British Isles.\n\nWe were thus not surprised to learn that Catholic rivals of ours on the continent have sent priests to [Root.GetName] in the hopes of returning the population to the Catholic faith. What do we do?"
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTOPTA4:0 "Is the effort to turn the Gaels from Catholicism an endless struggle?! Let them be damned."
 BtPLegacyIrishReligious.EVTOPTB4:0 "We must not waver in our faith. Do whatever must be done to show the Gaels the truth."
 #Celtic flavour!
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTNAME1:0 "Selection of the Tanist"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC1:0 "The time has come to select a new Tanist from the available Righdamhna, or Kingly Material. All Dearbhfhine, the male decendants of previous kings up to four generations back, are to vote in the selection of a new Tanist so that in the event of the King's death the Tanist will immediately accend to the position, securing the succession and maintaining the uninterrupted leadership of the Kingdom."         #Was going for a historical basis, but it seems to history-book-ish, so rewriting it, but leaving the old one here   -   Tanistry is the traditional inheritance law of Ireland and most of Britain. Under this system, a Tanist is elected by popular vote of the Dearbhfhine, or the decendants of a previous king up to four generations back, from the available Righdamhna, or kingly material, who are Dearbhfhine of the age of majority and without any physical or mental deformity. Unlike most primogeniture succession laws on the continent, it is common for a brother, uncle, or nephew to be first in line to inheirit, and also unlike most elective monarchy laws on the continent, only the direct descendants of previously ruling kings were eligible. This system is highly stable and typically ensures a compentent king is chosen, but it also occasionally causes civil wars between distant cousins.
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTA1:0 "Select a suitable Tanist from the King's brothers, uncles and nephews."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTB1:0 "Select the most competent of the King's cousins and second cousins as Tanist."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTC1:0 "Select the most competent of the King's cousins and second cousins as Tanist."    #this is the female possible version, not a mistake.
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTD1:0 "Refuse to select a Tanist, and wait for a royal heir to be born to the King."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTE1:0 "Appoint young [Root.Heir.GetName], even though he is not of age."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTF1:0 "Appoint young [Root.Heir.GetName], even though she is not of age and female."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTG1:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] will make a fine Tanist"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTH1:0 "She may be a woman, but [Root.Heir.GetName] is capable."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTI1:0 "Let us abolish this outdated custom of Tanistry!"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTNAME2:0 "An Heir!"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC2:0 "A new male heir is now in line to the throne of [Root.GetName]! Succession is secure and the throne is safe, alleviating the fears and misgivings of farmer and noble alike."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTA2:0 "Wonderful news!"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTB2:0 "May [Root.Heir.GetName]'s place on the throne be guaranteed!"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTNAME3:0 "A... Female Heir?"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC3:0 "A new heir is now is line to the throne of [Root.GetName], but to the consternation of all, this heir is a young woman! The role of the king is to act as steward to the kingdom and, as part of the inauguration, ritually marries the female personification of the kingdom, imbuing her and by extension the land with his fertility. As a woman cannot fulfill this role, women are traditionally not eligible to ascend to the throne. The prospect of a female ruler is thus enveloping the entire kingdom in a dread panic that upon the ascension of [Root.Heir.GetName], the kingdom will begin to wither and die. Doomsayers proclaim that first the crops, then the livestock, and finally the people will shrivel up and die as the land becomes barren and empty. The royal advisors suggest that a small sum be set aside for the girl's inheritance and that she be disinherited from royal succession."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTA3:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] will make an excellent ruler, there is nothing to fear."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTB3:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] will one day rule, regardless of what these cowards say!"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTC3:0 "A woman cannot fulfill the duties of the High King...."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTNAME4:0 "Heir Comes of Age"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC4:0 "Young [Root.Heir.GetName] has finally come of age, and will be able to fulfill [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] duties should the High King die. At long last having a capable, adult Tanist will reassure the people and resolve the unrest bred from the fear of lacking leadership in a crucial time."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTA4:0 "This should finally appease the naysayers."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTNAME5:0 "A Strong Woman Candidate"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC5:0 "In a most unusual and unexpected turn of events, a headstrong and capable young woman has garnered support from some of the Dearbhfhine, and is being considered by many as Righdamhna, and thus eligible for the throne, despite the fact that typically her anatomy would preclude her consideration. Her opponents warn against a woman in the position, as the king is ritually married to the kingdom and his fertility is meant to ensure the success of harvests and livestocks. Her supporters, however, dismiss this as superstition and cite ancient sources and laws asserting a woman's right of inheritance. Shall we encourage the girl's ambitions, or instead select a less controversial candidate?"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTA5:0 "One of the king's male cousins will make a fine choice."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTB5:0 "To even be considered, this young woman must be worthy!"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTNAME6:0 "A High Queen Comes to Power"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC6:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] became High Queen of [Root.GetName] today in a grand coronation ceremony, recalling all the pride of the ancient traditions. Despite outward appearances, however, many in the kingdom are fearful for the future, and doubtful of our continued prosperity. The royal court is simply waiting for the young queen to make a mistake, and word has reached us that small riots are appearing in all reaches of the kingdom as the superstitious fear that their beloved kingdom will become as barren without a symbolic husband. If the High Queen is to prove these doubters wrong, she will have to endure much in the years to come."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTA6:0 "She will have to prove herself..."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTNAME7:0 "The High Queen Has Proven Herself"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC7:0 "After 20 years on the throne, the kingdom under the High Queen has not shriveled up and died. Calves continue to be born, harvests continue to ripen, and the people have not succumbed to some miasma of hopelessness and despair. Even the staunchest traditionalist is forced to admit that [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s reign has erased any doubt that a woman may rule in [Root.GetName]. In the future, female Tanists will likely face less resistance."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTA7:0 "She has indeed proven herself!"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTNAME8:0 "Death of the Tanist"
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTDESC8:0 "Following the tragic death of our former Tanist, we are facing pressure to appoint a replacement so that our kingdom may never be without a strong leader in the event of the unexpected death of the king. The Dearbhfhine has met and the Righdamhna have presented themselves, all that remains is to vote in the new Tanist, who will immediately assume control of the kingdom in the event of the king's death."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTA1:0 "Select a suitable Tanist from the King's brothers, uncles and nephews."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTB1:0 "Select the most competent of the King's cousins and second cousins as Tanist."

 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTF1:0 "Appoint young [Root.Heir.GetName] as Bantanist."
 BeyondTypusCelticFlavour.EVTOPTG1:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] will make a fine Tanist"

 #African Events
 BtPLegacyUpperNileEvents.EVTNAME1:0 "Pressure from the Shilluk"
 BtPLegacyUpperNileEvents.EVTDESC1:0 "Historically our home has been the northern part of the Sudd, a sprawling and near-untraversable swampland located along the upper reaches of the White Nile. Recently, however, our southerly neighbours, the Shilluk, are encroaching more and more upon our territory. Faced with the prospect of a war we may not win, many nobles are suggesting we flee to the north, leaving the Sudd to the Shilluk and claiming for ourselves the drier area around the confluence of the White and Blue Niles, which in recent years has been under the control of the waning Alodia."

 BtPLegacyUpperNileEvents.EVTDESC2:0 "Occasionally a particularly rich or ambitious individual with no royal blood or legitimate claim is able to amass a fighting force and tries to carve out his own little kingdom. One such man, named Abdallah, has amassed quite a fortune from the Red Sea trade and has used this newfound affluence to gather a considerable army near our eastern border, now even threatening our sovereignty! Using his wealth and influence he has managed to obtain considerable popular support and stands ready to sack our ancient capital of Soba, should we resist. Alternatively, we could spare the nation a bloody war and abdicate the throne to this Muslim."
 BtPLegacyUpperNileEvents.EVTOPTA2:0 "This is our nation, and we will not give in without a fight!"

 BtPLegacyUpperNileEvents.EVTDESC3:0 "After being pushed north out of the Sudd by our ancient rivals, the Shilluk, we turned the push into forward momentum towards the north, and are now focused on establishing a powerbase near the confluence of the White and Blue Niles. In order to achieve this, we must defeat the current owners of the Alodian region!"

 BtPLegacyMetis.EVTNAME1:0 "The Métis"
 BtPLegacyMetis.EVTDESC1:0 "The early explorers and colonists arriving in French Canada were largely young men from low-born families looking for better opportunities than they might have had in their native France. Beginning in the 17th century, many of these French trappers and voyageurs began taking Algonquian women as wives in 'marriages à la façon du pays' or marriages according to the customs of the country. The results of these unions were an entirely new and unique culture and language, seperate from that of either parent. This new race was called Métis by the French, meaning mixed race people."

 BtPLegacyMetis.EVTOPTB1:0 "We must put an end to this!"
 BtPLegacyMetis.EVTNAME2:0 "The Anglo-Métis"
 BtPLegacyMetis.EVTDESC2:0 "Much like the French before them, the early explorers and colonists of British Canada occasionally took Algonquian or Dene women as wives. The results of these unions were an entirely new and unique culture and language, seperate from that of either parent. Usually known as the Anglo-Métis, these people were also often called 'countryborn'."

The results of these unions were an entirely new and unique culture and language, seperate from that of either parent. Usually known as Bungi, coming from the Cree word 'bangii', meaning 'little bit', these people were also often called 'countryborn'."

 BeyondTypusHeavyHandedAIColonialEvents.EVTDESC1:0 "Today a brave young soul, low-born but ambitious, presented himself at the capital with the hope that the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] will grant him and a small group of followers land in the New World. With our ambitions in the New World widely known and the perceived lack of opportunities for advancement to those not born into wealth and position in [Root.Owner.GetName], he presumes to ask for land overseas in unclaimed territory.\nThis pioneer and his group of followers have even amassed a small sum, enough to purchase their own passage and start their new life, and only await your permission to grow our borders!"

 BeyondTypusColonialCultures.EVTNAME1:0 "Canadian Culture"
 BeyondTypusColonialCultures.EVTDESC1:0 "The early French settlers in Canada came largely from the north and west of France, but once in the New World, the colonists soon established their own culture and traditions. Influenced by Algonquian and Huron natives, and shaped by the harsh realities of their frigid new home, these settlers began to call themselves 'Canadiens'."
 BeyondTypusColonialCultures.EVTOPTA1:0 "An intriguing development."
 BeyondTypusColonialCultures.EVTNAME2:0 "Afrikaner Culture"
 BeyondTypusColonialCultures.EVTDESC2:0 "The early settlers of the Cape Colony came mostly from the Low Countries and spoke Dutch, but quickly established their own culture and traditions in the face of the startling new reality in which they found themselves. Known as Boers (farmers), Burghers (citizens), or simply Afrikaners, this group is an entirely new people and at home in this distant land."

 tir_na_ngael_nation_desc:0 "The Gaelic peoples continue to maintain close ties on either side of the Sea of Moyle, but seperated by geography and under the yoke of Germanic powers, the Gaels have slowly drifted apart.

 albion_nation_desc:0 "Ever since the Saxons invaded and stole our ancient homeland from us, we have dreamed of recovering all of the Isle of Britain. Our ancient legends tell of Arthur's return to lead us to victory against the Saxons, but we cannot wait on legends to save us, for the glory of all Britons, let us found Ynys y Cedyrn, the Isle of the Mighty, and reclaim the whole of our beautiful island and beyond!"
 btpl_scottish_nation_title:0 "Form Scotland"
 btpl_scottish_nation_desc:0 "Hundreds of years of invasions and immigration has done nothing but make our great nation stronger. We may hold land on the fringes of Europe, but we are anything but irrelevant, and above all, we are free under Scotland the brave!"

 united_kingdom_nation_desc:0 "We have established a firm hegemony over all of the British Isles, but autonomous and sometimes rebellious vassals frustrate our plans whilst uneccessary local governments divert our taxes and complicate administration.

Armenians have since been displaced and marginalized, but we now stand ready to take the first step towards restoring Armenians to their rightful place of prestige.

 embrace_irish_traditions_desc:0 "When our ancestors were installed by the Anglo-Norman aristocracy hundreds of years ago, we were meant to represent English interests and curb local power, but Ireland has become our home. Gaelic traditions are observed, Irish is the language we hear spoken most often, and our closest allies and friends are the Gaels, not some distant English overlord. We should make this official!"

 create_the_kingdom_of_ireland_as_england_desc:0 "We have established dominance over Ireland, but we face the wrath of other European countries because of this annexation, and the rebellious nature of this frontier makes it difficult to govern effectively. The ideal solution may be to create a new Irish viceroyalty, similar to the former feudal system but significantly more organised, who may rule in our stead and protect our interests while distancing us from direct governance."

 #sweads_and_geats_one_big_happy_family_desc:0 "The two primary peoples of Sweden, the Swedes in the north and the Geats in the south, have lived together under the Swedish banner for many years and despite occasional friction, the two groups largely accept one another and recognise each other as kin. It is time we made it official and formally proclaim Swedes and Geats to be one and the same people, for the glory of Sweden!"         #removed in 11.5
 recognise_marcharid_of_brittany_title:0 "Recognize young Marc'harid of Brittany as heir"
 recognise_marcharid_of_brittany_desc:0 "Historically, women were able to inherit the duchy of Brittany, and our regnal histories proudly feature the names Janed, Alis, Bertha, and Hawiz, but per the Treaty of Guérande, which ended the War of the Breton Succession, we observe primarily Salic inheritance laws, forbidding women to inherit unless there is no surviving male in the entire line. Unfortunately, Fransez's infant son died in 1440 and his simple brother Pêr is also childless. The Montfort branch of the house of de Dreux is facing extinction, and some feel it may be wise after all to recognise Fransez's eldest daughter, Marc'harid, as heir to the duchy. She is a capable young woman, and her grandfather is the King of Scotland, which may facilitate good relations with them. Unfortunately, France would certainly view this as a violation of the treaty and would be very upset with us, and some factions inside the duchy may even view this as a violation of the law."
 #bt_enforce_temporal_authority_title:0 "Enforce Temporal Authority"
 #bt_enforce_temporal_authority_desc:0 "The Papal States consist of many de facto independent rulers who barely acknowledge papal authority and contribute nothing to the Patrimonium Sancti Petri as a whole. We should begin the slow process of reintegrating these various smaller states into a united and strong state by clarifying the temporal as well as the spiritual authority of the Holy See and consolidating the Patrimonium Sancti Petri!"

The solution is to create a new trading capital firmly under our control and give it a monopoly on all foreign trade. Let us hire the greatest architects and workers to create a beautiful, grand, new port!"

 # Genoese Option and Response
 flavor_gen.16.t:0 "The Surrender of Galata"
 flavor_gen.16.d:0 "The fall of Constantinople in 1453 to Mehment the Conqueror finally secured the City of World's desire for the Ottomans. However, we still hold Galata and it's tower across the Golden Horn and the Turk knows it, since we could use the city as a possible future staging ground for invasions to retake Constantinople. No Turkish conquest of the Bospohorus can ever be achieved so long as Galata [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] remains standing. [TUR.Monarch.GetName] has now finally taken matters into his own hands by directly demanding the city and its tower surrender.\nUnless we surrender to the Ottoman Empire we are very likely looking at a hasty resumption of hostilities and our inevitable doom."

 flavor_gen.17.d:0 "The fall of Constantinople to our most exalted Sultan has finally given us control of this magnificient City of World's Desire. However, despite our victories over the infidel, one stronghold remains as a thorn in our sides and that is the city of Galata and its imposing tower, which if ignored could still act as a staging ground for future christian invasions to the city of Istanbul. The Genoese have repeatedly evaded the question and it is becoming increasingly clear that many in the Turkish camp are arguing that the treaty will not be honored. In one last attempt to force the question [Root.Monarch.GetName] has approached the county capital, Galata, himself and demanded the surrender of the city.\nThe local commander, however, shows no signs of intending to open the gates, despite not having a force strong enough to withstand an attack."

However, we still hold the strategic port which both London and Madrid both know is vital to the control of all trade flowing in and out of the Mediterranean Sea. No Spanish or British domination of this inland sea can ever be achieved so long as Gibraltar remains in our hands.

One of several options proposed by Secretary of War, in complete cooperation with the Admiralty is for the seizure and Gibraltar. The rock it-self is of very little agricultural significance but the strait which passes it is of vital strategic and potential economical importance, as it will allow whoever controls it dominance over evertyhing that passes in and out of the Mediterranean Sea. In one last attempt to force our demands, King [Root.Monarch.GetName] government has has issued a demand for the immediate transfer of rule over the Rock of Gibraltar. \nThe local commander, however, shows no signs of intending to open the gates, despite not having a force strong enough to withstand a British attack."

For both battle and parade drill, Western Line Infantry formations consist of two to four ranks of foot soldiers drawn up side by side in rigid alignment, thereby maximizing the formations effectiveness and firepower."
 western_square:0 "Western Square"
 western_squareDESCR:0 "The Western Square, also known as a hollow square, is a combat formation in which infantry units are formed in close order, usually when threatened with cavalry attacks. Traditionally, infantry units would form standard lines in order to advance on the battlefield, with the aim of unleashing a powerful volley towards the enemy at the end. Although effective in the latter, this form of maneuver made infantry lines vulnerable to more nimble cavalry, which could sweep around the flanks of the formation and attack from the undefended rear or burst through the line, with much the same effect. By arranging the unit so that there was no undefended rear, a commander could organise an effective defense against a cavalry attack at any given location on the battlefield, thus driving them back or detering any cavalry attacks to begin with."
